# Inclusive Design: 5 myths that are holding you back

"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect". Tim Berners Lee

Inclusive Design is the process of actively considering the needs of people who are typically excluded and marginalised, from the beginning and throughout the design process. It is best achieved by designing with (rather than for) people who are often excluded.

Accessibility is one of the outcomes Inclusive Design strives for. In the context of the Internet, accessibility means that websites and apps are easy to use for people in as many circumstances as possible – including when they have an impairment.

Most accessiblity issues are easy to avoid. And yet, most websites and apps are impossible or too difficult to use for millions of people with impairments in the UK.

The problem is that most designers, developers and managers don't know enough about digital inclusion and accessibility. 

Here are five common myths that need challenging.

## Myth #1: People with disabilities are a small minority
### Reality: A quarter of the population – and increasing – report disabilities

The UK Department for Work and Pensions (DfP) estimates that 13.3m people in the UK have a impairment that has ‘substantial’ and ‘long term’ negative effects on their ability to do daily activities (1). The DfP also estimates that, at any time, another 5.4m people have temporary impairments.

That's as many people as in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff, Ireland and Northern Ireland all put together.

The US Census Bureau reports even higher figures (2):
* 30% of those aged 18+ report a disability, and 20% a severe disability
* 58% of those aged 65+ report a disability, and 42% a severe disability

The truth is, a huge number of people have disabilities. And we’re all, in fact, only temporarily not disabled.

## Myth #2: Inclusive design only benefits disabled people
### Reality: Inclusive design benefits everyone

Designing solutions that work for people with disabilities also benefits people in lots of other situations.

This is because impairments can be permanent, temporary or situational.

For example:
* Being Deaf is a permanent hearing impairment
* An ear infection is often a temporary hearing impairment
* Being in a loud pub is a situational hearing impairment

Captions are an example of inclusive design that will help people in all these situations.

In the same way, dropped kerbs are helpful if you use a wheelchair, push a pram, drag heavy luggage or ride a bycicle.

Anything that we do to benefit people with a permanent impairment, will also benefit people with temporary or situational impairments.

## Myth #3: Making a website accessible means adding expensive features
### Reality: Most accessibility issues are avoided just by following standard good practice

#### The Web is inclusive by default

HTML and CSS – the foundations of any website – have accessibility baked right into them. They've been designed to allow different people can consume the same web content in lots of different ways:
* visually, using zoom or enlarged text
* via a screen reader or speech detection
* using a mouse or an eye-gaze device
* a keyboard, a switch control or a sip-and-puff device

Web browsers and operating systems have most of these accessibility features built in. Your website will support most of these features for free, provided that designers follow good practices and developers write good HTML.

#### We've been putting barriers' in people's way

In spite of the Web being inclusive by default, most websites and apps get the basics of accessibility wrong.

In early 2019, WebAIM checked the accessibility of the homepages of the top 1m websites (3). Here are some of the issues they've found:

* 85% of web pages have text with insufficient contrast
* 59% of form inputs (like text boxes, check boxes or radio buttons) don't have accessible names (4)
* 58% of pages have links without accessible names (5)
* 34% of images lack an `alt` attribute (6)

All these issues can be avoided just by following standard good practices.

This is true about most accessibility barriers on the web.

The problem isn't a lack of time or budget. The problem is a lack of awareness.

"Far too often we design for the fictional average user. We can't presume that people have good vision, full hearing, good dexterity, use a mouse or a touch screen, are good at reading and have good memory". Alistair Duggin, former Head of Accessibility at the Government Digital Service

## Myth #4: Designing with disabled people in mind is not within the scope of your project
### Reality: Most people with impairments are able unless *we* disable them

There are two very different ways to think about disability:
* The 'medical model of disability' says that people are disabled by their impairments or differences
* The 'social model of disability' says that people are disabled by barriers in the environment

If you have an impairment and struggle to use a supermarket's website, for example, the medical model assumes that the problem is your impairment (not the website). The medical model suggests that people with impairments are unable to do things.

The social model of disability makes a distinction between having an impairment and being disabled.

If you have an impairment and struggle to use a website, the social model doesn't assume that your impairment is the problem. Instead, it asks whether the website has been designed inclusively.

"Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society." Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation, 1975

“No one comes to our websites disabled. They come with impairments. We disable them". Jamie Knight, autistic research engineer at the BBC

The truth is that, if we're not careful to design inclusively, it's very easy to accidentally introduce barriers that make it too difficult for millions of people to use the web.

The social model of disability reminds us of our responsibility as designers.

## Myth #5: Inclusive design is too difficult, and I'm not qualified
### Reality: Improving accessibility is easy, and you have permission to make mistakes

It can feel like you need to know lots before you can make a positive impact on accessibility – or avoid mistakes. 

It's actually very easy to make a difference, even as a beginner. Here's why.

#### The most common accessibility issues are simple and easy to avoid

The state of accessibility on the web is so poor today because not enough people have made accessibility their responsibility. By learning something about accessibility, you will make things better.

#### You don't need to re-invent the wheel

Experts have created excellent guides and videos to break things down for you. Reading or watching these, as much or as little as you like, will automatically make you a better, more inclusive designer. In particular, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are inclusive design principles will tell you how to avoid a lot of the common mistakes.

#### You don't need to be a developer

The problems and techniques described in the Accessibility Guidelines often assume some technical knowledge. But just getting familiar with HTML and CSS will get you a very long way. You don't need to learn Javascript, or the latest trendy web frameworks or technologies to understand accessibility.

#### It's easy to get help from experts

The web accessibility community is one of the most helpful and welcoming ones online. There are channels created especially for beginners to ask questions. Experts want to make a difference and will volunteer their answers.

#### It's OK to make mistakes

You will make mistakes. The best accessibility experts have started by not knowing things, and still make mistakes. As Léonie Watson, blind Accessibility Engineer, said [TODO: FINDQUOTE RE. PERMISSION TO MAKE MISTAKES].

## Change the culture around you

Exclusion is a habit. We find many reasons not to design or develop more inclusively.

But as designers we have power and influence. And digital exclusion is a habit that we are best placed to stop.

The task can seem daunting. But it quickly gets easier. You get a lot of help, because lots of people want you to succeed.

And it makes the job a lot more interesting and fulfilling.

"How many opportunities do we have to dramatically improve people’s lives just by doing our job a little better?” Steve Krug, author of Don't Make Me Think
